This font generator will generate font, kinda in the name really :P

Run the .exe and follow the instructions. Ensure that font has the correct name with no spelling mistakes.

Once the font has been generated the files 

Title.bmp and Title.dat will have changed YOU NEED BOTH!

Go to the folder

\Data\UI\Fonts

and you will find 4 files

Title.bmp, Title.dat, Bubble.bmp, Bubble.dat

Replace the Title.bmp and Title.dat with the new Title.bmp and Title.dat that you generated. This will change
all the font in the game apart from chat bubbles.

To change the chat bubble font you need to paste the Title.bmp and Title.dat that you generated into the folder
and rename both to Bubble.bmp and Bubble.dat

The Bubble.bmp and Bubble.dat generated by the font gen doesn't work properly hense why you have to use the Title ones

Hope this helps with your projects :)
