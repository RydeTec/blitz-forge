## Contribute

### Users

Users can help contribute to the BlitzForge by submitting [ideas](https://github.com/RydeTec/blitz-forge/discussions/categories/ideas) 
and [bugs](https://github.com/RydeTec/blitz-forge/issues).

### Developers

If you would like to add to BlitzForge source please feel free to clone or fork the repo. If you would like to push a branch and open a 
pull request to have your modifications included as part of the official source please request to join the [RCCE Contributors](https://github.com/orgs/RydeTec/teams/rcce-contributors) group.

There are lots of things that developers of any level can do to help contribute. Simply adding comments to existing code, updating documentation, small code refactors or entirely new features are all welcome additions. It's always best to start small and increase complexity over time.

#### Strategy

Branch from `develop` and target pull request to `develop`. Releases will be a pull request from `develop` targeting `master`.

##### Tests

You could also help writing tests in blitz as well. All tests should live under the [tests](tests) folder and you can run all tests by running the `test.bat` script. Tests are run before every git commit locally and must pass for your commit to succeed.

#### C++

If you are familiar with C++ you can help by making improvements or changes to the Blitz runtime [source code](src\blitzrc).

### Community

You can contribute just by being a part of the community and participating in discussions. We would love to see you there!
