This is a first prompt that your players are all greeted with once they run the client. This is a good
time to display an End User License Agreement.

This is the EULA file and you can edit this by going to /Data/Game Data/EULA.txt

Or deleteing everything in the file skips this screen completely.

Do not delete the file itself however.

----------------------------------------
You can Change all the textures of the buttons in the main menu by replacing the textures in the 

\Data\Textures\Menu

Folder. Make sure you use the correct file type otherwise you get an error. Ensure you make a 
backup of all the original textures before incase something goes wrong :)
-----------------------------------------
You can Change the Model in the background of the login screen by replacing the model in the Folder.

\Data\Meshes\LoginScreen\LoginSet.b3d
